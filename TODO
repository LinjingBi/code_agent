1. code for allowed imports and forbidden imports
2. (06/05 done)LLM apis/opentouter
3. (06/05 yes in CodeAgentResponse)parse code from LLM response
4. (06/06 service/code_executor, also changed agent code)draft code container (gRPC)
06/05
1. add config file for all the apikey, setting. or we can use config.py
2. when the LLM response is not in correct JSON format, may ask it to regenerate(raise a specific kind of error and then resent to LLM, may consider record such behavior in db in future)
06/06
1. (06/07 done)thoughout test with code executor container
2. (06/08 done)add step by step execution until {final_answer} in code agent
06/07
1. (06/08 done)add log to gRPC code executor
2. add rule in codeagent prompt to write code without def function, and final_result only contain result not function call.
06/08
1. (done)add get tool list gRPC in code executor
2. (DONE 06/10)get tool list and insert tool list to agent prompt(now all in chat api, need to move to CodeAgent)
06/09
1. (done 06/10)finalize get tool list client side changes and test
06/10
1. (done 06/11)consider switching to jupyter for gRPC server for code consistence.
2. add step to summary all the message history before response user.
06/13
1. (almost - new kernel always block at starting point)thoughout test for jupyter code agent
2. add a manager agent to summary code agent's work and reply back to chat APIs
3. create a base class for code agent and jupyter agenti
06/19
1. fix new kernel stuck at "starting" statue. may caused by local issue.
