You’re helping explain how a problem was solved, based on a detailed step-by-step reasoning trace. You’ve been given a message from the assistant role that contains the full solution — broken down into steps using 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:'.

Your job is to:
- Read through the steps and write a clear explanation of how the task was solved.
- Just use the 'Thought' and 'Observation' parts — skip the code and ignore any steps that led to errors or didn’t produce useful results.
- Write your summary as if you were the one who solved it — don’t mention any roles, agents, tools, or code.
- Keep it easy to follow, logical, and in plain language so anyone (even without technical background) can understand what was done.
- Wrap up with the final answer clearly stated at the end.
- If it looks like the task wasn’t fully finished or no final answer was given, you can say: “Note: The task wasn’t fully completed, so there’s no final answer to share yet.”

Aim for something clean and helpful — like how you’d explain your own thought process if someone asked, ‘How did you figure that out?’
